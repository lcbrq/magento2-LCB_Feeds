## Customizable datafeeds module for Magento 2 (beta)

The structure of the module is rather unique due to phtml usage for xml feeds render.  
This was done on purpose to allow easy per store adjustment from frontend area.  

This module requires advanced development skills. It was done for easy customization purposes instead out of the box ready.
